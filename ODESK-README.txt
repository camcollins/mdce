MDCE - Jquery Mobile Website Prototype

This prototype was created with the JQM Demo framework provided at http://jquerymobile.com. 
The theme consists of the following files:

- index.html - A basic JQM home page. The content-primary container was configured much in
the same way as the JQM demo site discussed above. This allows for two column layouts for
larger screen sizes like iPad. However for this application only one column is required.

NOTE: The icons only line-up when the browser is re-sized to 500 pixels or less. I didn't spend
much time trying to get it to work at larger sizes although it would be nice.

- mdce.css - Main style sheet

- style.css - Style sheet for slider

- mdce.js - A Javascript program that makes a number of "card" styles available. I used it to
add a rounded effect to the main buttons. The buttons can be found in ./images/buttons.
  
- slide-min.js - A Javascript slider. The sliding functionality seemed a bit clunky. Also the
image frames need to be stylized with a box as per the PSD. I will provide better resolution
spoonsor images. The image/frame size should be roughly 300 x 100. It would be great if the starting 
slide could be randomized. The images can be found in ./images/sponsors.
